Hello Guys,

See i have created a simple url shortner in python see firstly go to your vscode and make a new python file and uplaod this project codes into that file and see if u are facing error in like flask has no repositoy or like realted to flask
then plz do install flask with terminal by pip install flask and if not then go to google and search latest version of flask and do copy that code with the version and install it or else it will be installed by 
pip install flask


--------------------
Listen Plz copy the code and paste it on your file and before running once open terminal and see if there is any errror if everthing is okay just run the project and there in terminal you will see
a link with like this http://127.0.0.1:5000/ so plz copy that and go to that link and boom there you will see a url shortner just paste any big link like go to any site and just paste the url there in url shortner
you will press enter and there you can see a link just clik it and you will be redirected to your url shortner link.....

------------
NOTE:- The url shortner is only accessbile to local network or on same network see to make this domain or the domain public link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ like BIT.ly and all other so 
you must take a hosting or create own site and host there no no some free access also like any API key of any shortner just go and copy the api and edit the code to that api and boom the URL
will be puliclly acessbile now...



I hope i think this is not too much to just hippe in like this url shortner in python butt ya i have created this in 2 days i have created and edit lotts of things and also i have 
Done CSS HTML coding also very professionaly so ya i have bit knwoledge in this both but ya...
